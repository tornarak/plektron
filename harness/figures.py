"""The figure-caption track: `gt/fig/` for geometry, `data/readings.md` for text.

**The two are separate stores and neither substitutes for the other.** The 252
figure ALTOs in `gt/fig/` carry `GraphicZone` blocks (the images) and
`GraphicZone-FigDesc` blocks (where a caption sits) — 414 and 395 of them
respectively — and **no `TextLine` at all**: every line was stripped, because the
exported line segmentation dropped whole printed lines and a line-level witness
in the ALTO would have silently disagreed with the readings. So the caption text
lives only in `data/readings.md`, one block per FigDesc zone, keyed
`<ref>|<zone-id suffix>` and read by hand off the 300 dpi scans.

Anything that wants caption text must go through `readings()`. Reading
`String/@CONTENT` out of `gt/fig/` returns the empty string for every zone on every
page — not an error, just nothing, which is the worst possible failure here.

There is no longer a keyed/unkeyed boundary. All 395 captions in
`data/readings.md` are hand-read, so the old `KEYED_COUNT = 50` marker is gone;
`gt/fig/` and `data/readings.md` reconcile 1:1 in both directions, and that
reconciliation is the check worth running — `reconcile()` below.

Zone types are read from `OtherTag/@LABEL`, never from the tag ID. The IDs are
per-export (`BT55`/`BT56` in one export, `BT68`/`BT69` in the next) and code
that hardcodes them fails silently rather than loudly.
